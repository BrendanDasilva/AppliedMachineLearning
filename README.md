# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains my machine learning assignments. Each assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing various machine learning models using Python and popular ML libraries.

## Assignments

### 1. Fashion MNIST Classification
Fashion MNIST is an alternative to the classic MNIST dataset, featuring 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST but is considered more challenging due to lower achieved accuracy.

#### 🏷️ Class Labels
```
0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
4. Coat
5. Sandal
6. Shirt
7. Sneaker
8. Bag
9. Ankle boot
```

The video walkthrough answers 21 key questions about this dataset and its implementation.
