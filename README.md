# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains my machine learning assignments. Each assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing various machine learning models using Python and popular ML libraries.

## Assignments

### 1. Fashion MNIST Classification
Fashion MNIST is an alternative to the classic MNIST dataset, featuring 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST but is considered more challenging due to lower achieved accuracy.

#### 🏷️ Class Labels
```
0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
4. Coat
5. Sandal
6. Shirt
7. Sneaker
8. Bag
9. Ankle boot
```

The video walkthrough answers 21 key questions about this dataset and its implementation.

### 2. Neural Network Training and Optimization
This assignment focuses on training and optimizing a neural network on the **Iris dataset**. Key experiments include testing different **optimizers, number of layers, neurons, epochs, and batch sizes**, with comparisons of their effects on model performance.

#### 📊 Key Experiments:
- **Optimizers:** Comparing RMSprop vs. Adam
- **Number of Layers:** 2-layer vs. 4-layer networks
- **Neurons per Layer:** 10 vs. 50 neurons
- **Epochs:** 10 vs. 50 epochs
- **Batch Size:** 5 vs. 32 batch sizes

The video walkthrough explains each experiment, analyzes the results, and discusses how different hyperparameters impact model performance.
